# MIND
A novel multimodal interpretable nodule diagnosis framework for benign malignant lung nodule classification

# Highlights:
-- First mulimodal model that consider CT scan images, radiological attributes, and textual nodule description
-- Clinical informative interpretability by SHAP values in radiological attributes and hihglighing important word for nodule classification
-- Comprehensive ablation studies, including three-way cross-attention and contrastive loss-based joint embedding in a
shared latent space.
-- Text based classification is considered for pretrained domain specific PubMedBERT model on anatomoy aware generated textual description
